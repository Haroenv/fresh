# Creating Your Own List

- Read the [fresh manifesto](fresh.md) and ensure your list complies.
- Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- Your fresh list should be named `fresh-listname` and have a [license](fresh.md#choose-an-appropriate-license), and [contribution guidelines](fresh.md#include-contribution-guidelines). Adding a [code of conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/) is also strongly recommended.
- Make sure to regularly groom your fresh list for stale links!
- Make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) before submitting a request for your list to be added here.

Thanks for stayin' fresh!
